        <p class="para">Thy  rope  of  sands  .   .    .</p>

        <p class="para">— George  Herbert</p>

        <p class="para">The  line  is  made  up  of  an  infinite  number  of
points;  the  plane  of  an  infinite  number  of  lines;
the  volume  of  an  infinite  number  of  planes;  the
hypervolume  of  an  infinite  number  of  volumes.
.  .  .  No,  unquestionably  this  is  not — more  geome-
trico — the  best  way  of  beginning  my  story.  To
claim  that  it  is  true  is  nowadays  the  convention  of
every  made-up  story.  Mine,  however,  is  true.</p>

        <p class="para">I  live  alone  in  a  fourth-floor  apartment  on  Bel-
grano  Street,  in  Buenos  Aires.  Late  one  evening,  a
few  months  back,  I  heard  a  knock  at  my  door.  I
opened  it  and  a  stranger  stood  there.  He  was  a  tall
man,  with  nondescript  features — or  perhaps  it  was
my  myopia  that  made  them  seem  that  way.
Dressed  in  gray  and  carrying  a  gray  suitcase  in  his
hand,  he  had  an  unassuming  look  about  him.  I
saw  at  once  that  he  was  a  foreigner.  At  first,  he
struck  me  as  old;  only  later  did  I  realize  that  I  had
been  misled  by  his  thin  blond  hair,  which  was,  in  a
Scandinavian  sort  of  way,  almost  white.  During  the
course  of  our  conversation,  which  was  not  to  last
an  hour,  I  found  out  that  he  came  from  the  Ork-
neys.</p>

        <p class="para">I  invited  him  in,  pointing  to  a  chair.  He  paused
awhile  before  speaking.  A  kind  of  gloom  ema-
nated from  him — as  it  does  now  from  me.</p>

        <p class="para">"I  sell  Bibles,"  he  said.</p>

        <p class="para">Somewhat  pedantically,  I  replied,  "In  this  house
are  several  English  Bibles,  including  the  first —
John  Wiclif's.  I  also  have  Cipriano  de  Valera's,
Luther's — which,  from  a  literary  viewpoint,  is  the
worst — and  a  Latin  copy  of  the  Vulgate.  As  you
see,  it's  not  exactly  Bibles  I  stand  in  need  of."</p>

        <p class="para">After  a  few  moments  of  silence,  he  said,  "I  don't
only  sell  Bibles.  I  can  show  you  a  holy  book  I  came
across  on  the outskirts  of  Bikaner.  It  may  interest
you."</p>

        <p class="para">He  opened  the  suitcase  and  laid  the  book  on  a
table.  It  was  an  octavo  volume,  bound  in  cloth.
There  was  no  doubt  that  it  had  passed  through
many  hands.  Examining  it,  I  was  surprised  by  its
unusual  weight.  On  the  spine  were  the  words
"Holy  Writ"  and,  below  them,  "Bombay."</p>

        <p class="para">"Nineteenth  century,  probably,"  I  remarked.</p>

        <p class="para">"I  don't  know,"  he  said.  "I've  never  found  out."</p>

        <p class="para">I  opened  the  book  at  random.  The  script  was
strange  to  me.  The  pages,  which  were  worn  and
typographically  poor,  were  laid  out  in  double  col-
umns, as  in  a  Bible.  The  text  was  closely  printed,
and  it  was  ordered  in  versicles.  In  the  upper
corners  of  the  pages  were  Arabic  numbers.  I  no-
ticed that  one  left-hand  page  bore  the  number  (let
us  say)  40,514  and  the facing  right-hand  page  999.
I  turned  the  leaf;  it  was  numbered  with  eight
digits.  It  also  bore  a  small  illustration,  like  the  kind
used  in  dictionaries — an  anchor  drawn  with  pen
and  ink,  as  if  by  a  schoolboy's  clumsy  hand.</p>


        <p class="para">It  was  at  this  point  that  the  stranger  said,  "Look</p>

        <p class="para">at  the  illustration  closely.  You'll  never  see  it  again."</p>

        <p class="para">I  noted  my  place  and  closed  the  book.  At  once,  I
reopened  it.  Page  by  page,  in  vain,  I  looked  for
the  illustration  of  the anchor.  "It  seems  to  be  a
version  of  Scriptures  in  some  Indian  language,  is  it
not?"  I  said  to  hide  my  dismay.</p>

        <p class="para">"No,"  he  replied.  Then,  as  if  confiding  a  secret,
he  lowered  his  voice.  "I  acquired  the  book  in  a
town  out  on  the plain  in  exchange  for  a handful  of
rupees  and  a  Bible.  Its  owner  did  not  know  how  to
read.  I  srspect  that  he  saw  the  Book  of  Books  as  a
talisman.  He  was  of  the  lowest  caste;  nobody  but
other  untouchables  could  tread  his  shadow  with-
out contamination.  He  told  me  his  book  was  called
the  Book  of  Sand,  because  neither  the  book  nor
the  sand  has  any  beginning  or  end."</p>

        <p class="para">The  stranger  asked  me  to  find  the  first  page.</p>

        <p class="para">I  laid  my  left  hand  on  the  cover  and,  trying  to
put  my  thumb  on  the  flyleaf,  I  opened  the  book.  It
was  useless.  Every  time  I  tried,  a  number  of  pages
came  between  the  cover  and  my  thumb.  It  was  as
if  they  kept  growing  from  the book.</p>

        <p class="para">"Now  find  the  last  page."</p>

        <p class="para">Again  I  failed.  In  a  voice  that  was  not  mine,  I
barely  managed  to  stammer,  "This  can't  be."</p>

        <p class="para">Still  speaking  in  a  low  voice,  the  stranger  said,
"It  can't  be,  but  it  is.  The  number  of  pages  in  this
book  is  no  more  or  less  than  infinite.  None  is  the
first  page,  none  the  last.  I  don't  know  why  they're
numbered  in  this  arbitrary  way.  Perhaps  to
suggest  that  the  terms  of  an  infinite  series  admit
any  number."</p>

        <p class="para">Then,  as  if  he  were  thinking  aloud,  he  said,  "If
space  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  space.
If  time  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  time."</p>

        <p class="para">His  speculations  irritated  me.  "You  are  re-
ligious, no  doubt?"  I  asked  him.</p>

        <p class="para">"Yes,  I'm  a  Presbyterian.  My  conscience  is  clear.
I  am  reasonably  sure  of  not  having  cheated  the  na-
tive when  I  gave  him  the  Word  of  God  in  ex-
change for  his  devilish  book."</p>

        <p class="para">I  assured  him  that  he  had  nothing  to  reproach
himself  for,  and  I  asked  if  he  were  just  passing
through  this  part  of  the  world.  He  replied  that  he
planned  to  return  to  his  country  in  a  few  days.  It
was  then  that  I  learned  that  he  was  a  Scot  from  the
Orkney  Islands.  I  told  him  I  had  a  great  personal
affection  for  Scotland,  through  my  love  of  Steven-
son and  Hume.</p>

        <p class="para">"You  mean  Stevenson  and  Robbie  Burns,"  he
corrected.</p>

        <p class="para">While  we  spoke,  I  kept  exploring  the  infinite
book.  With  feigned  indifference,  I  asked,  "Do  you
intend  to  offer  this  curiosity  to  the  British  Mu-
seum?"</p>

        <p class="para">"No.  I'm  offering  it  to  you,"  he  said,  and  he
stipulated  a  rather  high  sum  for  the  book.</p>

        <p class="para">I  answered,  in  all  truthfulness,  that  such  a  sum
was  out  of  my  reach,  and  I  began  thinking.  After  a
minute  or  two,  I  came  up  with  a  scheme.</p>

        <p class="para">"I  propose  a  swap,"  I  said.  "You  got  this  book
for  a  handful  of  rupees  and  a  copy  of  the Bible.
I'll  offer  you  the  amount  of  my  pension  check,
which  I've  just  collected,  and  my  black-letter  Wiclif
Bible.  I  inherited  it  from  my  ancestors."</p>

        <p class="para">"A  black-letter  Wiclif!"  he  murmured.</p>

        <p class="para">I  went  to  my  bedroom  and  brought  him  the
money  and  the  book.  He  turned  the leaves  and
studied  the  title  page  with  all  the  fervor  of  a true
bibliophile.</p>



        <p class="para">It  amazed  me  that  he  did not  haggle.  Only  later
was  I  to  realize  that  he  had  entered  my  house  with
his  mind  made  up  to  sell  the  book.  Without  count-
ing the  money,  he  put  it  away.</p>

        <p class="para">We  talked  about  India,  about  Orkney,  and
about  the  Norwegian  jails  who  once  ruled  it.  It
was  night  when  the  man  left.  I  have  not  seen  him
again,  nor  do  I  know  his  name.</p>

        <p class="para">I  thought  of  keeping  the Book  of  Sand  in  the
space  left  on  the  shelf  by  the  Wiclif,  but  in  the  end
I  decided  to  hide  it  behind  the volumes  of  a  bro-
ken set  of  The  Thousand  and  One  Nights.  I  went
to  bed  and  did not  sleep.  At  three  or  four  in  the
morning,  I  turned  on  the  light.  I  got  down  the im-
possible book  and  leafed  through  its  pages.  On
one  of  them  I  saw  engraved  a  mask.  The  upper
corner  of  the  page  carried  a  number,  which  I  no
longer  recall,  elevated  to  the  ninth  power.</p>

        <p class="para">I  showed  no  one  my  treasure.  To  the  luck  of
owning  it  was  added  the  fear  of  having  it  stolen,
and  then  the  misgiving  that  it  might  not  truly  be
infinite.  These  twin  preoccupations  intensified  my
old  misanthropy.  I  had  only  a  few  friends  left;  I
now  stopped  seeing  even  them.  A  prisoner  of  the
book,  I  almost  never  went  out  anymore.  After
studying  its  frayed  spine  and  covers  with  a magni-
fying glass,  I  rejected  the possibility  of  a  contriv-
ance of  any  sort.  The  small  illustrations,  I  verified,
came  two  thousand  pages  apart.  I  set  about  listing
them  alphabetically  in  a  notebook,  which  I  was  not
long  in  filling  up.  Never  once  was  an  illustration
repeated.  At  night,  in  the  meager  intervals  my  in-
somnia granted,  I  dreamed  of  the  book.</p>

        <p class="para">Summer  came  and  went,  and  I  realized  that  the
book  was  monstrous.  What  good  did  it  do  me  to
think  that  I,  who  looked  upon  the  volume  with  my
eyes, who  held  it  in  my  hands,  was  any  less  mon-
strous? I  felt  that  the book  was  a  nightmarish  ob-
ject, an  obscene  thing  that  affronted  and  tainted
reality  itself.</p>

        <p class="para">I  thought  of  fire,  but  I  feared  that  the  burning
of  an infinite  book  might  likewise  prove  infinite
and  suffocate  the planet  with  smoke.  Somewhere  I
recalled  reading  that  the  best  place  to  hide  a  leaf  is
in  a  forest.  Before  retirement,  I  worked  on  Mexico
Street,  at  the  Argentine  National  Library,  which
contains  nine  hundred  thousand  volumes.  I  knew
that  to  the  right  of  the  entrance  a  curved  staircase
leads  down  into  the basement,  where  books  and
maps  and  periodicals  are  kept.  One  day  I  went
there  and,  slipping  past  a  member  of  the  staff  and
trying  not  to  notice  at  what  height  or  distance
from  the  door,  I  lost  the  Book  of  Sand  on  one  of
the  basement's  musty  shelves.</p>
